Code from Brad Traversy's [Express.js Crash Course](https://youtu.be/L72fhGm1tfE)

### About

- This is a simple app performing CRUD operations on a JSON object which stores member details
- Uses `express-handlebars` for viewing the list of members and adding data to it.
- Uses `Bootstrap CDN` for styling.
- Check `.nvmrc` for node version.

### How to run the project locally

- `npm i` to install dependencies
- `npm run dev` to start the server in watch mode using nodemon
- Create a `.env` file and define port (see `.env.example`). Default port is `5000`
